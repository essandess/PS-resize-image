PS Resize Image: Photoshop Javascript to Resize Images Respecting
Landscape and Portrait Orientations

This Javascript resizes images to the preset resolution along the
*shortest* dimension, whether the orientation is landscape or
portrait. It's useful for Photoshop automation. Copy this Javascript
to '/Applications/Adobe Photoshop/Presets/Scripts' and the script will
appear in the menu as 'Photoshop>File>Scripts>Resize Image for
1080p'. Edit the script and filename for other resolutions.
